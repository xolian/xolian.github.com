My passion is leading and building large scale application security testing automation programs.  Currently, I am a Sr. Product Security Engineering Manager at Target.  Our teams build Open Source and Internal automation products for Application Security testing.

When not doing application security I'm enjoying:

1. Yoga
1. Sitar 
1. espresso
1. beer
